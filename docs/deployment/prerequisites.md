# Deployment service — prerequisites & auth setup

The deployment service (`deployment-api`) promotes a container from Nexus into Google Artifact
Registry (GAR) and then deploys it to Cloud Run. The **GarPush** step shells out to the `crane` CLI;
the **CloudRunDeploy** step uses the Google.Cloud.Run.V2 admin API. Both need external tooling and
ambient credentials that are *not* checked into the repo. If any of the below is missing, the run
fails at the relevant step — and, since the change adding options validation, a missing/unresolvable
`crane` now fails service **startup** with a clear message instead of failing the first deploy.

## 1. Install crane (go-containerregistry)

Use go-containerregistry's `crane` — **not** the similarly-named `michaelsauter/crane` that some
package managers ship.

- Download `go-containerregistry_Windows_x86_64.tar.gz` from
  <https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/releases> and extract `crane.exe`, or
- `go install github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/crane@latest`

Verify: `crane version`.

## 2. Point the AppHost at crane + an isolated docker config

The stack runs under .NET Aspire (`src/Aspire/Cicd.Aspire.Host`). The AppHost injects
`Deployment__GoogleCloudRun__CraneExecutable` and (optionally) `DOCKER_CONFIG` into `deployment-api`
from its **user-secrets** — this env var outranks `appsettings*.json`, so configure it here, not in
appsettings:

```powershell
dotnet user-secrets --project src/Aspire/Cicd.Aspire.Host set Parameters:CraneExecutable "C:\path\to\crane.exe"
dotnet user-secrets --project src/Aspire/Cicd.Aspire.Host set Parameters:DockerConfigDir "C:\path\to\cicd-docker"
```

`DockerConfigDir` is the directory holding the `config.json` that crane reads for registry auth. We
use a dedicated dir because the default `~/.docker/config.json` uses Docker Desktop's locked
`desktop` credential store, which crane can't use for these registries. Leave it unset to fall back
to crane's default.

## 3. Seed registry auth (into `DockerConfigDir`)

Point `DOCKER_CONFIG` at the same dir for these one-time commands:

```powershell
$env:DOCKER_CONFIG = "C:\path\to\cicd-docker"

# Nexus (Docker) — for pulling the source image
crane auth login <nexus-host:8082> -u <user> -p <password>

# GAR — register the gcloud credential helper for each region you deploy to
gcloud auth configure-docker us-west1-docker.pkg.dev      # add us-central1-docker.pkg.dev, etc. as needed
```

Verify a region resolves: `crane auth get us-west1-docker.pkg.dev` should print a credential JSON,
not `Reauthentication failed…`.

## 4. Application Default Credentials (Cloud Run)

The Cloud Run deployer authenticates via ADC — no credential is configured in code. Provide one of:

- `gcloud auth application-default login` (local dev), or
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointing at a service-account key file, or
- Workload Identity (when running in GCP).

If the gcloud helper used for GAR (step 3) reports `Reauthentication failed. cannot prompt during
non-interactive execution`, refresh with `gcloud auth login` **and**
`gcloud auth application-default login`, then restart `deployment-api`.

## 5. Configure the deployment target

Region, GCP project and GAR repository live on the **environment**; the Cloud Run service name lives
on the **mapping**. Set these via the deployment API / admin UI before triggering a run — there is no
default seeding. The run snapshots them at request time.

## Troubleshooting

Failures are categorized (`StepFailureKind`) and shown in the completion toast and on the run's step
detail (`GET /api/deployment/runs/{id}`):
